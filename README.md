# Data-Engineering
This repository is a place where I learn about Data Engineering.

This repository is based on the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) by DataTalksClub.

What I learned so far in this Zoomcamp:

1. Using Docker to run many applications and create and run data pipelines to process data.
